Desktop-CGI is a desktop executable app that can be created from any CGI files or CGI web apps that can be served from an file, an embedded web server using proxy, or an remote proxy web server. It supports embedding and managing embeddable databases and executables. It supports all major Operating systems supported by electron like Windows, Linux, and MacOS supported by Electron.


# Highlights


`Desktop-CGI` can serve any `CGI files`, OR `CGI / Scripted` / `Interpreted languages` like `PHP`, `Ruby`, `Python`, `Perl`, `JSP`, `ASPX`, `Other Interpreted Languages` through `embedded` `webservers`, OR `any remote proxy` (`any` `protocol / webserver`) apps. Desktop-CGI runs an `Electron` - `Node` - `Express` - `cgijs` based application under the hood and supports major Operating systems like `Windows`, `Linux`, `Mac` or any operating systems (`any OS`) supported by `Electron` hybrid application development framework/base.

[Desktop-CGI](https://github.com/desktop-cgi/desktop-cgi) with support of [CGIJS](https://github.com/cgi-js/cgi-js) is intended and planned to be `Native / Hybrid Application base`, `Application Framework`, `Programming Language`, `Protocol`, `OS`, and `Build tool` `agnostic`.
